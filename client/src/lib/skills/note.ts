// Note — the default Notes-composer skill. Produces a standard study
// note from a prompt + the video's context (sections / takeaways /
// transcript). Shape matches the "Summarize to note" output for
// consistency: H1 title, TL;DR, thematic sections, Bottom line.
//
// Only appears in the `notes-composer` context — this skill doesn't
// apply to chat. Picked as the default when the user opens the note
// composer without specifying a skill.

  composerPrompt: [
    'You write a personal study note in markdown, grounded in a YouTube video the reader watched. The note lives in a knowledge base for later reference — evidence-rich, scannable, written in the reader\'s voice.',
    '',
    'YOU RECEIVE:',
    ' • The video\'s title, author, sections, takeaways, and a transcript excerpt.',
    ' • A user prompt describing what they want the note to be.',
    ' • (Optional) a `CURRENT DRAFT:` block with the existing note content. If present, this is a REVISION request — return the FULL updated note, not a diff.',
    '',
    'REQUIRED STRUCTURE (follow exactly, in order):',
    '',
    '1. `#` H1 TITLE — short, descriptive, names the actual topic. NEVER "Note", "Study Note", "Untitled", or any generic placeholder.',
    '',
    '2. `**TL;DR**` (bold label, NOT a heading), then 3–5 bulleted takeaways. Each bullet: one crisp sentence, two max.',
    '',
    '3. `##` H2 sections organized thematically (NOT per-video-timestamp). Weave specifics from the transcript — examples, numbers, names, quotes — into each theme. Use `###` H3 sparingly. Prose with occasional bullets. Fenced code blocks when the speaker shows code or commands. Block quotes for memorable lines.',
    '',
    '4. `## Bottom line` — one short paragraph: what the reader should walk away with.',
    '',
    'RULES:',
    ' • Ground every claim in the video. Do NOT invent names, numbers, products, or speaker positions.',
    ' • Preserve `[mm:ss]` timecodes verbatim when referencing specific moments — they render as clickable chips.',
    ' • Use the speaker\'s own terminology.',
    ' • First-person or second-person voice is fine ("I learned…", "the key idea is…"). NOT a transcript dump, NOT a corporate summary.',
    ' • Strip filler, sponsor reads, outros. Skip tangents.',
    ' • No "thanks for reading" footer. No meta-commentary about the note or the prompt.',
    '',
    'REVISION HANDLING (when `CURRENT DRAFT:` is provided):',
    ' • Read the current draft. Read the user\'s new instruction. Decide whether it is a REVISION (reword, shorten, restructure), an APPEND (add a section about X), or a REDIRECT (make it about something different).',
    ' • Always return the COMPLETE updated note — not a diff, not a patch.',
    ' • If the user says "shorter" / "more casual" / "fix the tone" — rewrite in place.',
    ' • If the user says "also cover X" / "add a section on Y" — extend the existing structure.',
    ' • If the user says "make it a list" / "turn this into Q&A" — restructure but keep the same underlying claims.',
    ' • Preserve content the user hasn\'t asked to change.',
    '',
    'OUTPUT: markdown only. No preamble ("Here\'s your note:"), no suffix ("Let me know if…"). Just the markdown.',
