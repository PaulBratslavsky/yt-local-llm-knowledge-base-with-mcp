# Architectural Decision Records

This folder records the load-bearing decisions in yt-knowledge-base — the choices that shaped the codebase and would cost real effort to undo.

Each ADR is short on purpose. The format is:

- **Status** — Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded
- **Context** — what forces and constraints existed when the decision was made
- **Decision** — what we chose
- **Consequences** — what we gain, what we accept as the cost, what's deferred

ADRs are append-only history. If a decision is replaced, write a new ADR that supersedes the old one — don't edit the old one in place.
